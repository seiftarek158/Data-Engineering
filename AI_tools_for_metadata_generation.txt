🧠 Additional Notes

Primary Key: transaction_id uniquely identifies each record.

Derived Columns: total_trade_amount, average_trade_size, is_weekend, and is_holiday may be computed from base data.

Categorical Fields: transaction_type, customer_account_type, day_name, stock_liquidity_tier, stock_sector, and stock_industry.

Boolean Fields: is_weekend, is_holiday represent logical True/False conditions.

Log Transformation Note: The stock_price column is stored in logarithmic form for normalization. To obtain the actual stock price, apply the exponential transformation using numpy.exp(stock_price) or math.exp(stock_price).

Would you like me to add a short Python code snippet to your README that shows how to reverse-transform and compute total_trade_amount using the log-transformed prices?
